# IDL_misc
Miscellaneous IDL procedures that may be useful for astronomical research but are not included in the IDL Astronomy User's Library (ASTROLIB).

None of these procedures were authored by me, though some minor edits may have been made to some of them so that they would work properly in my direct imaging pipeline, and authorship (if available) should be at the beginning of each procedure.
